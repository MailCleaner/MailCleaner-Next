$htxt['INTRODUCTION'] = '
<h1>Welcome to a world where the e-mail you get is the e-mail you want.</h1>
<p>MailCleaner is an extremely powerful antivirus and anti-spam system.</p>
<p>Based on the latest generation of filtering technology, MailCleaner does not need to be installed on your computer.
Instead, it acts before e-mail messages reach your mailbox, at the highest level of the network infrastructure of your company, organization or ISP.
MailCleaner relies on sophisticated rules that are updated daily by the engineers of the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em> in response to spammers\'
ever-changing strategies and the appearance of new viruses. Thanks to MailCleaner\'s unblinking surveillance, you can be assured 24 hours a day
that you have the best tool to prevent viral attacks, intrusion of dangerous files and undesirable e-mail messages.</p>

<h1>Take a couple of minutes to discover how MailCleaner works with your e-mail software.</h1>
<p>This chapter contains all the necessary information to help you master your new antivirus and anti-spam system in just a few minutes.
The default configuration of the MailCleaner filter immediately provides you with maximum protection, so you can rely on MailCleaner from the very start.</p>
<p>MailCleaner requires only minimal attention on your part. It works autonomously to eradicate viruses, identify dangerous content and remove spam from your e-mail 24 hours a day.
MailCleaner works transparently, and you will receive regular quarantine reports that will tell you everything about its activity.</p>
<h2>Quarantine reports </h2>
<p>As a MailCleaner user, you will be receiving a quarantine report for each e-mail address that is protected by the system. Quarantine reports may be sent to you daily,
weekly, or monthly, depending on the configuration chosen by your e-mail administrator or your Internet Service Provider (ISP). A quarantine report lists all the messages
received in a given period that are identified as spam. These messages are quarantined, meaning that they are retained in a special zone outside of your e-mail system.</p>
<p>During the first few weeks as a new MailCleaner user, you should examine your quarantine reports carefully to make sure that the system does not inadvertently block any
legitimate e-mail message that should have been delivered to your mailbox. Such instances are very rare, but not impossible.</p>
<p>After a test period, you will have the option to disable the delivery of quarantine reports, depending on whether or not you are interested in reviewing
the activity of the filtering system.</p>

<h2>What to do if a message is blocked inadvertently</h2>
<p>It is possible, although extremely rare, that a message that you want to receive is blocked by MailCleaner.  This may be caused by different factors, such as a non-standard
format of the e-mail message or a compromised reputation of the mail server used to send the message. It does not mean that MailCleaner is malfunctioning, but simply that the
system acts cautiously when encountering an e-mail message with unusual characteristics that cannot be correctly interpreted by a simple scan of the message contents.</p>
<p>If you encounter such a situation, there are two things you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Release the message</em> from the quarantine to allow it to reach your mailbox.</li>
<li>Notify the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em> so that the engineers may render the filter more tolerant towards
  the sender or format of the blocked message. This is referred to as a <em>filter adjustment</em> in the MailCleaner vocabulary.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure about the nature of the message that has been blocked, you can view its contents before deciding whether it should be released
  or not via the MailCleaner Management Center.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em>, located on our premises, is composed of a team of highly specialized engineers whose role
is to guarantee the highest possible quality of filtering in response to global spam traffic, emergence of viruses and filter adjustment requests emanating from users worldwide.</p>
<h3>Viewing the contents of a message</h3>
<ul>
 <li>To view a message, click on the date, the subject or the preview icon.</li>
 <li>The contents of the message are displayed in a new window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Releasing a quarantined message</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on the message release icon next to the message of interest.</li>
<li>A copy of the blocked message is sent to your mailbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Filter adjustment request</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Click on the filter adjustment request icon next to the message of interest.</li>
 <li>Confirm your request;</li>
 <li>A filter adjustment request is sent to the Analysis Center along with a copy of the blocked message.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you use any of the preceding tools available in the quarantine report, your browser will open a new window or a confirmation dialog box.</p>
<h2>What to do if a spam has not been blocked</h2>
<p>If a spam slips undetected through the MailCleaner system, the differences between this spam and a legitimate e-mail message are likely very small.
In such a situation, MailCleaner chooses to deliver the message to your mailbox. It is better to receive spam on an exceptional basis than to miss a potentially
important legitimate message.</p>
<p>If you receive a spam message, you should request a filter adjustment to fine tune MailCleaner detection rules.</p>
<h3>Spam received by Microsoft Outlook</h3>
<p>A plug-in may be added to Microsoft Outlook for Windows to automatically notify MailCleaner that unfiltered spam has been received.
This plug-in installs a button in the menu bar that displays the MailCleaner logo and the caption <em>Unwanted</em>.</p>

<p>To notify the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em> of received spam using the MailCleaner plug-in:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Select the received spam in the list of messages.</li>
 <li>Click on the Unwanted button in the Tools bar.</li>
 <li>A filter adjustment request is sent to the Analysis Center along with a copy of the unwanted message.</li>
 <li>You may then delete the spam.</li>
 <li>No confirmation will be sent to you, but your request will be taken into account in the continuous filter adjustment process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the MailCleaner plug-in is missing in Outlook, ask your e-mail administrator to install it
for you or consult the installation instructions in this manual.</p>
<h3>Spam received by another e-mail program</h3>
<p>All filter adjustment requests resulting from unwanted spam must be sent manually to a specific e-mail address at the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This address is defined by your e-mail administrator or ISP. It cannot be found in this manual.</strong>
To obtain this address, click on the Help section of the Management Center and then on Filter Adjustment Request.
Copy the e-mail address, as it will be needed in the subsequent steps.</p>
<p>To manually notify the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em> of received spam:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Select the received spam in the list of messages.</li>
 <li>Resend the message using the resend function of your e-mail software.</li>
 <li>Type in or paste the e-mail address for filter adjustment requests obtained previously.</li>
 <li>A filter adjustment request is sent along with a copy of the unwanted message.</li>
 <li>You may then delete the spam.</li>
 <li>No confirmation will be sent to you, but your request will be taken into account in the continuous filter adjustment process.</li>
</ul>

<p class="important"><strong>Important:</strong> Do not forward the contents of the spam message using the copy and paste function.
Doing so will prevent the transmission of the long header in the original message which is needed to properly analyze the spam.
Regardless of your e-mail software or operating system (PC or Mac), you should only use the Resend function (or its equivalent) to send your filter adjustment request. </p>

$htxt['FAQ'] = '

<h1>Simple answers to common questions.</h1>
<h2>Management Center</h2>
<h3>Where can I get my user name and password?</h3>
<p>For any given address filtered by MailCleaner, your user name and password are the same as those used for your e-mail account in your standard e-mail software.</p>
<h2>Spam and quarantine</h2>
<h3>What is a quarantine?</h3>
<p>A quarantine is an isolated zone outside of your mailbox which retains messages identified as spam.</p>
<h4>Filter adjustment</h4>
<h3>What is a filter adjustment?</h3>
<p>A filter adjustment results from a request that you decide to make when you encounter a legitimate mail that is wrongfully quarantined,
or a spam message that is wrongfully delivered to your mailbox. In the first case, MailCleaner will relax a rule to be more tolerant towards
a specific sender or format. In the second case, MailCleaner becomes more strict.</p>
<h3>What happens when I request a filter adjustment?</h3>
<p>A copy of the message is sent to the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em>. The message is examined by MailCleaner engineers and the filter may be corrected.</p>
<h4>Quarantined messages</h4>
<h3>A legitimate message has been mistakenly quarantined. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Release the message to allow its delivery to your mailbox and request a filter adjustment from within the quarantine.</p>
<h3>Why did MailCleaner quarantine a message that I was supposed to receive?</h3>
<p>Such a situation may occur if the message was relayed by a mail server that may temporarily have a compromised reputation, caused for example by spammers
that use it as a spam relay. Alternatively, a specific, unusual format of the message may have triggered an anti-spam rule.
It does not mean that MailCleaner has malfunctioned, but simply that the system acts cautiously when encountering unusual characteristics of an e-mail message
that cannot be correctly interpreted by a simple scan of the message contents.</p>
<h3>How do I release a message?</h3>
<p>Click on the arrow icon located on the same line as the message to release it. This can be done either in the quarantine report or within the Management Center.</p>
<h3>I have released a message, but it is still displayed in the quarantine. Is this normal?</h3>
<p>A released message is kept in the quarantine in case you need to release it again in the future. It is displayed in italics to indicate that it has been released.</p>
<h3>What do I do to stop receiving quarantine reports?</h3>
<p>You may change the frequency at which quarantine reports are sent, or disable this option, in the Configuration section of the Management Center.
If you choose to disable reporting, you will need to visit your Management Center to consult your quarantine.</p>
<h4>Unblocked spam</h4>
<h3>A spam has not been filtered. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Use your e-mail software to request a Filter Adjustment which will reinforce the filter rules.</p>
<h3>Why did MailCleaner let a spam reach my mailbox?</h3>
<p>Some spam messages manage to slip through the filter because none of the mathematical analyses carried out at the time were able to differentiate it from legitimate e-mail.
It is therefore very important that you report this error to the <em>MailCleaner Analysis Center</em>, which will then reinforce the relevant filter rules.
In borderline situations, MailCleaner chooses to deliver the message to your mailbox, since it is better to receive spam on an exceptional basis
than to miss a potentially important message.</p>
<h2>Viruses and dangerous messages</h2>
<h3>How does MailCleaner handle viruses?</h3>
<p>Viruses are eliminated without any notification.</p>
<h3>What do you mean by dangerous content?</h3>
<p>Dangerous content is the type of content that your e-mail administrator must filter as a preventive measure. Examples include attachments with executable scripts (.exe)
or links to suspicious web sites. MailCleaner removes dangerous content and delivers the remainder of the message to your mailbox along with a note explaining how to ask
your administrator to send you the complete message.</p>
<h3>How do I know that a message included dangerous content?</h3>
<p>The subject of such a message includes a keyword&mdash;usually "{DANGEROUS CONTENT}"&mdash;as well as an attached document explaining how to release it.</p>
<h3>How do I obtain this dangerous content from my e-mail administrator?</h3>
<p>Follow the instructions in the message attachment. To receive the retained content, you must provide the ID of the message that was blocked.
If your administrator believes that the original attachment poses a genuine threat, he or she may refuse to forward it to you.</p>
