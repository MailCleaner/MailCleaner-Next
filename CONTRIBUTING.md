## Areas where we would appreciate your help

### Alpha/Beta testing of upcoming major release

This repository (MailCleaner-Next) represents many months of effort to update the Current version of MailCleaner which is based on Debian Jessie, to a brand new Debian Bookworm base. This effort has so far consisted of changes to almost 1 million lines of code and configuration files and updating all core packages, libraries and scripts. During that time, some things have almost definitely been updated incorrectly or broken.

We are now welcoming Alpha testers to [install MailCleaner](/INSTALL.md) on top of a generic Debian Bookworm installation and test all of the functionality.

There are a series of open Issues for the [Alpha Milestone](https://github.com/MailCleaner/MailCleaner-Next/milestone/1) which track progress until the [Beta Milestone](https://github.com/MailCleaner/MailCleaner-Next/milestone/2). We encourage our Community Edition users to wait for the Beta version before attempting to use this project in a production environment. The Alpha version is meant for testing with non-essential domains/sub-domains since we are providing no guarantees for deliverability or quality Spam filtering. We will not support this version for Enterprise Edition until all Beta Milestone goals are completed and the project can be marked as Stable.
