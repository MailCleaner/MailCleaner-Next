# sample whitelist for DCC clients

# Changes in this file and the files it includes are noticed automatically
#   within a few minutes.


# See the dcc man page for the format of DCC whitelists.
#   Each line must be in one of the forms:
#count [hex] type value
#      [hex] type value

# Hexadecimal checksum values can be obtained from dccm, dccifd, and
#   dccproc log files.
