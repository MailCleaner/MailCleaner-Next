# This is an example ruleset to show how rules can have resulting values
# other than yes and no. This ruleset demonstrates having a numerical result.
# The From: and To: rules show how simple domains can be used to select
# different values for the result of the ruleset.
# Note that the fields of each rule line can be separated by any whitespace,
# any combination of tabs and spaces.
#
# The 2 lines involving domain3.com show that for email to user@domain3.com
# has a limit of 5Mbytes per message, while email to any other user
# @domain3.com has a limit of 500Kbytes per message.
#

#To:       *@domain1.com     10M
#To:       *@domain2.com     20M
#From:     user@domain3.com   5M
#From:     *@domain3.com     500K

#
# The following line specifies the default result used when none of the
# other rules match. In this example,
# Maximum Message Size = 0
# means that there is no limit to the size of the message.
#

#FromOrTo: default           0
