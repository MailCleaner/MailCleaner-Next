# You can use this ruleset to enable the "bounce" Spam Action.
# You must *only* enable this for mail from sites with which you have
# agreed to bounce possible spam. Use it on low-scoring spam only (<10)
# and only to your regular customers for use in the rare case that a
# message is mis-tagged as spam when it shouldn't have been.
# Beware that many sites will automatically delete the bounce messages
# created by using this option unless you have agreed this with them in
# advance.

# This next line gives an example of how you might enable this option for
# a frequent customer of yours.
#From:		yourcustomer.com	yes

# Under no circumstances should this be changed to "yes".
